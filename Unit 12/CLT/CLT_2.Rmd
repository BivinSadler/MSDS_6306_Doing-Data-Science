# Simulator to Demonstrate CLT

## Control Parameters
```{r}
df = read.table("/Users/bivin/Desktop/OLD COMPUTER ARCHIVES/KadAfrica/MSDS/DDS/MSDS 6306/Unit 5/yob2016.txt",stringsAsFactors = FALSE,header = FALSE,sep = ";")
n1 = 10 # sample size per sample for 1st distribution
n2 = 100 # sample size per sample for 2nd distribution (we will compare these distribuions) 
simulations = 1000 #number of samples and thus number of xbars we will generate.  
mu = 0; # mean parameter for use with normal distribuions
sigma = 1; # standard deviation parameter for use with normal distribuions
```

## Data Holder
```{r}
xbar_holder1 = numeric(simulations) # This will hold all the sample means for the first distribution.
xbar_holder2 = numeric(simulations) # This will hold all the sample means for the second distribution.
```

## Simulate and Store
Generate 1000 samples each of size 10 and find the mean of each sample.  Then store each mean in the xbar_holder vector.

```{r}
for (i in 1:simulations)
{ 
  sample1 = rnorm(n1,mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  sample2 = rnorm(n2,mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  xbar1 = mean(sample1)
  xbar2 = mean(sample2)
  xbar_holder1[i] = xbar1
  xbar_holder2[i] = xbar2
}
```

## Display the Distribution of Sample Means 
#### (plot a histogram of the sample means)
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
hist(xbar_holder1, col = "blue", main = paste("Distribution of the sample mean: n = ", n1), xlab = "Dist 1 Sample Means", xlim = c(-4,4))
hist(xbar_holder2, col = "red", main = paste("Distribution of the sample mean: n = ", n2), xlab = "Dist 2 Sample Means", xlim = c(-4,4))
```

## Summary Statistics 
```{r}
summary(xbar_holder1) #5 number summary and the mean
summary(xbar_holder2) #5 number summary and the mean
sd(xbar_holder1) # standard deviation of dstribuion 1
sd(xbar_holder2) #standard deviation of distribuion 2

```
